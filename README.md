# scrap.fish
**Scrap folder generator for the Fish shell.**

## Why?
I often find myself creating scrap folders, so I wanted a convenient tool to automate the process.

## What it does?
1. Accepts a name for your scrap folder.
2. Generates a random ID for the folder.
3. Creates the folder in `~/Scrap/[folder-name]-[random-id]`
